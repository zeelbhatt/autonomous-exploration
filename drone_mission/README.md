# Rocky-Times-Challenge-SES598-ASU
This code is the part of midterm assignment for SES 598 Autonomous Exploration System Course at Arizona State University (ASU). The project involves moving the quadcopter close to a probe for data mulling, later move towards precariously balanced rock, revolve around it and create PointCloud map using ORBSLAM2 and land safely on Rover.

The phase-1 world consist of bishop mars terrain along with a probe, a precariously balanced rock, a rover and a quadcopter.
The task includes below points in the given sequence
1. Set offbaord and go to the probe for data mulling (distanceThreshold = 1 meter)
2. After data mulling is completed, move closer to rock and map the entire rock using OrbSlam2
3. Once mapping is completed, move towards the pre-defined location where rover is parked and land on it safely.
4. All the above sequence of action must happened autonomoulsy without human intervention in between.
